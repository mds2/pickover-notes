Pickover notes
===========

These are notes and scratch computation made while reading
Clifford Pickover's "Mazes for the mind"

They are organized by chapter.

As these started out as my scratch work for my own amusement while reading,
not all of them are thoroughly explained.  I hope that some sense can be
made out of them by readers who look them up while reading the corresponding
chapters in the original work.

The book for which these are notes is an eclectic mix of
recreational mathematics, hobby programming puzzles, profiles
of artists, cultural asides, and weird curiosities.

It reads as if a bunch of old Martin Gardner columns, an 80s hobbyist
programming magazine, an art gallery retrospective, and a few back issues of
"News of the Weird" were placed in a blender together and came out as
a compendium of loosely related standalone chapters with a vaguely
free-jazz hint of an organizational structure.

For a book published in 1992, and clearly aimed at advanced high school or
early college students, I found it surprisingly readable and entertaining
as an experienced programmer in 2018.

The 1992 publication date, and its vaguely technological-ish subject focus,
means that (as of the time I'm writing this) used copies sell for the prices
one would expect of a 1992 computer technology book.

Ironically, however, the sections of the book that seem to be the most "dated"
26 years later aren't the programming sections (he does provide pseudocode
that mimics C and Fortran, while a modern book would likely provide pseudocode
in the style of Python and Java) but the frequent asides on various people's
opinions about whether "computer art" was really "art".  I imagine that in
the early 1900s people must have had similarly silly discussions about whether
photograph was "really art".

In the spirit of the bygone age in which the book was written, I typed
most of my notes as snippets of Common Lisp programs.  I am of the opinion
that Common Lisp would have been the most appropriate 1992-era language with
which to attack and explore the problems and puzzles presented in Pickover's
"Mazes for the Mind"

Incidentally, one of the correspondents of the author who sent in
solutions to puzzles discussed in Chapter 73 ("The Terrible Twos Problem")
agreed with me on this (hindsight) language choice and solved the problems
in that chapter in some lisp dialect (presumably, although not necessarily,
common lisp).  RIP Dan Hoey.
